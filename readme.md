Pewpew, to do:

-Receive balancing opinions and feedback!  Quite honestly I put some thought into balance but wasn't super careful.  A point valuation system would be nice.
-Patch Kunai!  It's currently removed.  Either to be thrown like pilums, which would mean they couldn't have crafting values, or make an atlatl-like "kunai set" that fires "kunai."  The latter option would allow for it to be wielded in melee as well.  Still a bit janky, I'm not sure which option is best.



Misc Notes
Point valuation system attributes:
-Bulk
-Crafting level requirement
-Damage
-Attack Speed
-Slower weapon speeds, slower weapons still attack instantly when first engaging in combat, making them far more valuable.  They do still linger in place after attacking though.
